Hi! I'm **Khanh**. I'm interested in **Mathematics**.

In my own **black space**, where **mathematical computation** thrives, I immerse myself in **abstractions** and **intuitions**. It's where I **focus**, **memorize**, and **envision** everything.

I might make a thousand mistakes, but they must be distinct; absolutely **no mistake** is allowed to **repeat**.
